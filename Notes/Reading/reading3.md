#3.0
* understanding interpreters
* OOP:
Emphasis on Data structures
Data object and operations under that object
*Basics of interpreter:
Tokenizer converts into special characters
parser parses the tokens, constructs them properly
Evaluator determining value of var's as well as interpretation of code
Printer is the output #Where in this does it get sent down to lower levels, if I had to guess it's either in between the parser and the evaluator (less likely) or between the evaluator and the printer (more likely) I understand it's there at every step but when is it executed as machine language in the virtual machine (if this makes any sense at all)
*Simulating an interpreter sucks (I've done it before)
#3.1
*Non-Local Refferences- var search takes the most local var and uses it
*In Summation, there was very little I didn't know in that reading.
